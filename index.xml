      <description>Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹ I am a computer scientist, software engineer, and full stack developer aiming to solve problems with out of the box thinking. In otherwords I make computers go beep-bop ðŸ¤– to solve problems in our lives._
I like to manipulate things till they break, or just to re-make them in a data oriented manner for a better experience. Meaning I like to break, manipulate, optimize software. I might leverage parallel computing, data science, algorithms, or artificial intelligence to create a better and lighter solution.</description>
