A dreamy transit client for NYC Subways. It&rsquo;s outrageously lightweight and powerful *when the MTA isn&rsquo;t lying about where the trains are. <em>hosted on Glitch</em></p>
<h1 id="ancient-ui-stuff">&ldquo;Ancient&rdquo; UI Stuff</h1>
<p><a href=""><strong>Word Based Clock</strong></a>
You don&rsquo;t need to <strong>buy</strong> a word clock, when you can just emulate it in your browser with Local User Time and some JS magic to stay in sync and beautiful. Currently only available in dark mode. <em>hosted on static GH Pages</em></p>
<p><a href=""><strong>Dot Matrix LED Emulator</strong></a>
Why spend time soldering LEDs when you can just use your browser to just <em>emulate</em> a dot-matrix LED display in <strong>full RGB glory</strong>. Create your custom colors and designs or just use Text-to-Display for some quick dot-matric messages. <em>hosted on static GH Pages</em></p>
<p><a href=""><strong>Color Mini-Canvas</strong></a>
Why let yourself or home become a mess with paint? Create your custom colors and designs in the digital realm on this ephemeral web page &ldquo;canvas&rdquo; and forget the mess. <em>hosted on static GH Pages</em></p>
<p><a href=""><strong>Candy Matching</strong></a>
<strong>Actually not a ripoff of Candy Crush</strong>, more just a flip card game using candy as the playing medium. Its a bit loud [turn down your speakers <em>OR</em> mute the program (mute available on the page!)]. You <em>can</em> save your score to your local browser if you so desire. <em>hosted on static GH Pages</em></p>
<p><a href=""><strong>Definitely Not Evil Dice Roller</strong></a>
Why bother wasting real money when your going to get hustled anyway? Play from the comfort in your own home, without losing any actual money on this definitely not rigged dice game (it&rsquo;s rigged.) <em>hosted on static GH Pages</em></p>
<p><a href=""><strong>More Legacy Stuff</strong></a>
There just more in the pit of history, dive in here. No guaranteed on what you will find. (Everything here is fun stuff that runs entirely in your browser, and is <em>actually</em> safe. Mostly fun tiny things that might entertain a child for between 1 to 1800 seconds.)</p>
